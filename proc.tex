\chapter*{Introduction}

Dear Reader,

You are holding a~printed proceedings of the Second International Go
Game Conference, taking place in Liberec, Czech Republic, as a~part of
European Go Congress 2015.

The aim of the conference is to share knowledge between researchers
and to show the game of Go from (hopefully) interesting and new point
of view to the general Go public visiting the congress.  The numeral in
the conference name has been chosen to be ''Second'' to promote the idea
of Science Conferences on Go Congresses, which -- to our knowledge --
started on 2013's congress in Olsztyn, Poland. We sincerely hope that this
newly-founded tradition will continue in the forthcoming years as well.

In this proceedings, you will find the four conference
submissions. Despite all our effort, we were obviously unable to attract
many authors; our conclusion is that it was probably a mistake being so
formal with publication process and visual style. Nevertheless, we still
hope you will enjoy both reading the papers and the conference itself.

The conference would not be possible without our program committee members
Martin Müller, Peter Shotwell and Thomas Wolf, thank You. Finally,
we would like to thank our sponsor, mathematician and philanthropist
Karel Janeček.
